When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So i can download and share it anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because the local repositoryu may have some changes that i dont want to share in the remote one
