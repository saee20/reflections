When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So i can download and share it anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because the local repositoryu may have some changes that i dont want to share in the remote one

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are inside github, clone makes a copy in the computer and branche are for experimenting
